  -= midi singer =-

Korlessa lets you play that damn synth from a command line. You don't need other tools just fire your synth up, plug it into the computer, and write some cool tunes. And, oh, you need a Linux computer. Sorry.

In other words; Korlessa is a command line sequencer. It can schedule midi events based on an original music notation format.
